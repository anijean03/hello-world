hello-world for csc155
I am a senior in high school going to Parkland studying 2 classes, and will be graduating high school in May. Then I plan on going to Parkland for the next two years where I can get my gen eds out of the way. After parkland, I will be going to Purdue to study web programming and development. I love coding websites.
